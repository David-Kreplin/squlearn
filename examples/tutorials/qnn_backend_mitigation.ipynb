    "## Error Mitigation for QNNs on IBM Devices\n",

    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates the setup and implementation of error mitigation techniques for Qiskit's primitives within the context of Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) in sQUlearn. Firstly, we will train a small QNN using a noise-free and error-free simulator to fit a parabolic data set. Subsequently, we will illustrate how to configure the `Executor` class to establish a connection with IBM Quantum devices. We assume that you have already set up an IBM account and have access to IBM Quantum devices. For detailed instructions on registering and configuring your IBM Quantum account, please refer to the following link: [IBM Quantum Account Management](https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/ibm-runtime/how_to/account-management.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the potentially lengthy queuing times for the free quantum devices, we will replicate the noise model of a quantum device and use the QASM simulator to emulate the real characteristics of a quantum computer. The simulator employed in this task, known as the `ibmq_qasm_simulator`, operates within the IBM Quantum cloud and can be accessed similarly to the actual quantum devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore various error mitigation options for both the Estimator and Sampler primitives. Finally, we will demonstrate how to train the QNN on the quantum device (simulator) to adapt to noisy configurations and reduce finite sampling noise through variance regularization [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step involves importing the necessary libraries for this tutorial. We will be using the `qiskit-ibm-runtime` package to establish connections with IBM Quantum devices and `qiskit-aer` to simulate the noise model of these quantum devices. Additionally, we will employ the `squlearn` library to configure and train the QNN on the quantum device."

    "### Retraining the QNN on the IBM Backend without Error Mitigation using Variance Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "In the subsequent section, we illustrate the process of retraining the Quantum Neural Network (QNN) to achieve improved results on real quantum hardware. A crucial aspect of this approach is that we train the QNN on the same hardware on which it is subsequently evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the training process is capable of adapting to the hardware's imperfections, the need for error mitigation diminishes, allowing the final inference to align closely with real-world data. To address the noise stemming from finite sampling on real hardware, we employ variance regularization (as detailed in [1]). This regularization technique reduces the variance of the expectation value in addition to the L2 Loss, thereby ensuring a lower variance of the final inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the initial step, we disable any error mitigation techniques. Throughout the optimization process, we utilize the ``Sampler`` primitive since it enables us to compute the additional expectation values needed for variance computation from the same set of circuits, eliminating the necessity for additional, costly circuit evaluations."

This value serves as the pre-factor for the variance regularization term within the loss function. While recommended values typically fall within the range of 0.01 to 0.0001, the specific choice depends on the QNN's capacity to fit the data effectively.\n",
